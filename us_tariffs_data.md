### Justification for Tariffs:
The executive order cites several reasons for implementing these tariffs:
1. Large and persistent US goods trade deficits ($1.2 trillion in 2024)
2. Lack of reciprocity in bilateral trade relationships
3. Disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers
4. Hollowing out of US manufacturing base
5. Undermining of critical supply chains
6. Dependence on foreign adversaries for defense-industrial base
7. National security concerns
