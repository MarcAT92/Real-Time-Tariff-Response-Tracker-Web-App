## Analysis Summary

The stocks listed above are likely to be significantly affected by the recent US tariffs and country responses. US companies with significant exposure to international markets, particularly in manufacturing, technology, and consumer goods sectors, are vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs from countries like China. Foreign companies exporting to the US market will face increased costs due to the new tariffs, potentially impacting their competitiveness and profitability.

This analysis is based on recent stock performance and sector exposure to tariffs. The actual impact may vary as markets continue to react to policy developments and company-specific factors.
